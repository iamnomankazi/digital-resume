      <h3>The Odin Store - An eCommerce Project</h3>
      <p>
        I've built this e-Commerce/Clothing store project, named after the Norse
        god, Odin.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is based on Python, Django, React JS, and Bootstrap.</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          In this project, I have used React JS and Bootstrap for the front end
          and Python and Django for the back end.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          For designing parts, I used Canva and for the payment gateway, I
          used Braintree.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          It has some custom design products, which I designed in Canva like
          t-shirts, hoodies, and sweatshirts with the logo and name of the Odin.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          You can add products in Django Admin Panel (which is completely
          user-friendly) with their image, name, description, size, price,
          category, and stock and they will show up on the website as Bootstrap
          Cards.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          It has a working Shopping Cart with the payment gateway Braintree
          (which is owned by PayPal)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          You can actually buy the products by adding them to the cart, and then
          you can checkout and pay with PayPal or any Credit/Debit cards.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
