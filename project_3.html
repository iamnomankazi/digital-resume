      <h3>The Netflix Clone</h3>
      <p>
        I've built this basic clone project of the popular subscription-based
        streaming service Netflix.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In this project, Iâ€™ve used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front end
          and Python, and Django for the back end to power up the website
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          In this project, you can watch selected movies/web series and it has a
          recommendation system too, which means it will recommend movies/web
          series based on what you watch.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          You can upload videos/movies/series with their name, description,
          poster in Django Admin Panel with different categories/genres and they
          will show up on the website as Bootstrap Cards.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Then you can click the 'Watch' button to watch the video/movie/series.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          It will recommend you similiar movies/series based on the
          categories/genres you watch.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
