      <h3>Pong Game Using Pygame</h3>
      <p>I've built a basic Pong game using Python's Pygame library.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can play it using keyboard's W and S keys for the left side player
          and ⇧ (Up Arrow key) and ⇩ (Down Arrow key) for the right side player.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The game is played on a window with a resolution of 800x600 pixels.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          It'll also show who's going to win with the score and winning message.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          In future, maybe I'll add some improvements to the game, like AI
          teaches itself how to play Pong Game and Win.
        </li>
      </ul>
